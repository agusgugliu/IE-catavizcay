EXERCISE NÂ°8
Write a program that manages the outstanding invoices of a company. The invoices will be stored in a dictionary where the key of each invoice will be the invoice number and the value will be the invoice cost. The program must ask the user if he wants to add a new invoice, pay an existing one or terminate. If you want to add a new invoice you will be asked for the invoice number and its cost and it will be added to the dictionary. If an invoice is to be paid, the user will be asked for the invoice number and it will be removed from the dictionary. After each operation the program should display on the screen the amount collected so far and the amount still to be collected.
