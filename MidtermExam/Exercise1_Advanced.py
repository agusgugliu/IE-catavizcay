EXERCISE NÂ°1 (Advanced Version)
You are given a text string representing a directory of a company's customers, similar to the one provided below, where each line contains a customer's name, email, phone number, tax ID, discount, and customer category (e.g.: "VIP", "Regular", "New"). The lines are separated by a newline character. and the first line contains the field names.

Example input:
    "tin;name;email;telephone;discount;category\n01234567L;Paul Harry; paulharry @mail.com;656343576;12.5;VIP\n71476342J;Alice Brown;alice@mail.com;692839321;8;Regular\n63823376M;Peter Williams;peter@mail.com;664888233;5.2;New\n98376547F;Rose Anderson;rose@mail.com;667677855;15.7;VIP"

Write a program that creates a dictionary where each key is a TIN, and its value is another dictionary containing all the customer's details.
Additionally,
    - the program should categorize the customers into sub-dictionaries based on their discount range (e.g.: 0-5%, 5-10%, 10-15%, >15%).
    - the program should also return the total number of VIP customers and their average discount.
